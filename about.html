        <p class="fs-body">Hi, my name is Rhodri and I’m a user experience (UX) designer currently working at Motokiki, a tyre comparison website.</p>
        <p class="fs-body">I’ve worked in the design industry since graduating from Newport School of Art, Media and Design in 2001 with BA Hons in Graphic Design.</p>
        <p class="fs-body">I have seven years agency experience working at Freshwater Creative and ten years experience working in the public sector at the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In addition to this, I spent seven years working as a freelance designer while working full-time at ONS. I worked on a variety of digital and print projects for a range of clients such as Sport Wales, Wales Millennium Centre, NHS, Merthyr Council and Cardiff University.</p>
        <p class="fs-body">My core skills revolve around user-centred design, guiding product teams to make decisions based on evidence and user-needs. I strive for a clean, functional design, always paying attention to the finest detail.</p>
