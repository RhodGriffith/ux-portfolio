							<h2 class="u-mt-l u-fs-xl">ONS Business Register</h2>
							<p class="u-fs-body">The ONS Business Register was an internal legacy uplift project within ONS to replace the current Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR). The register is a comprehensive list of UK businesses used by government for statistical purposes. It provides the main sampling frame for surveys of businesses carried out by ONS and other government departments. It is also an important data source for analyses of business activities.</p>
							<p class="u-fs-body">The two main sources of input are VAT and PAYE records from HMRC. Additional information comes from Companies House, Dun and Bradstreet and ONS business surveys. The register covers around 2.7 million businesses in all sectors of the economy.</p>
							<h3 class="u-fs-m u-mt-m">Project discovery</h3>
							<p class="u-fs-body">During the discovery phase of the project, there were key questions we needed to answer.</p>
							<ol class="list u-mt-s">
								<li class="list__item">Which other internal business services would the register interact with?</li>
								<li class="list__item">Who were the current users of the business register and what did they do?</li>
								<li class="list__item">How could we improve the register for our current users?</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="u-fs-body u-mb-m">To answer the above, I conducted in depth research with internal users and stakeholder. Typical activities included facilitating workshops, surveys, interviews, user persona development, mapping pain points on the current user journey.</p>
