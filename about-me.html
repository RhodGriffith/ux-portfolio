						<p class="u-fs-s">Hi, I’m Rhodri and I’ve worked in the design industry since graduating from the University of South Wales in 2001. With an agency background in graphic design, experience working as a digital designer within government and a recent work history as a user experience designer in the private sector, I’m highly skilled in every aspect of the design process.</p>
						<p class="u-fs-s">My core skills revolve around user centred design – creative problem-solving with a scientific and evidence based approach to design. I’m a firm believer in designing products and services that are centred around user needs. Clean, functional design, paying attention to the finest detail.</p>
